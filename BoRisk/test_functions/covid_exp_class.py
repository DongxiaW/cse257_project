Simulator code is in directory group-testing.
This an attempt on making a callable experiment class based on the
covid simulators developed for Cornell reopen analysis.
First step here is to just make their simulator into a callable.
Next step would be to make it into a multi-dimensional test problem

    See the problem description in the paper. This here is just a bunch of ideas.
    Single population covid sim based on tutorial notebook
    The parameters are modified from base_params.py
    You can skip the rest.
    Things we can modify to make things interesting:
        the parameters playing int avg_infectious_window
        pop_size
        daily_contacts
        prob_infection ? not sure what this is
        prob_age -- age distribution - might be a good idea to use population level data
        sample_QI-S exit functions - not sure what these are
        exposed_infection_p
        mild severity levels ?
        self report probabilities
        days between tests
        test pop fraction
        QFNR - QFPR
        contact tracing parameters
        initial counts and prevalence

    Here is how the output is:
        run_multiple_trajectories returns a list of each trajectory output
        each trajectory includes a pandas data frame where each row corresponds to a time
        and each column gives the number of people in that category in that time.
        To get the number of infections, we simply add up the relevant columns.

    Contacts between different populations: we could just add something to "step" that
    would handle this. or even a separate simple method that would just generate new
    infections from these contacts see lines 357+ (stochastic_simulation) on how this
